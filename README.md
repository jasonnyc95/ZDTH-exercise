Zendesk Take Home Assessment
This is the submission from Ng Yau Chuan Jason for the Zendesk Take Home exercise.

The code was developed in NetBeans, the project folder can be found in the OtherFiles folder in this submission.

The java files were then extracted to the folder, TicTacToe_Java_NxN_SourceCode, compiled and tested for the TestCase report. Instructions on how to run/compile the java program were added to this folder, if necessary.

The program was initially developed to solve the 3x3 Tic Tac Toe problem then refined and edited to process NxN Tic Tac Toe problems.
